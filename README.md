# Deep playground

Deep playground is an interactive visualisation of neural networks, written in
TypeScript using d3.js. Descriptive information on how to inteprate the components is available on the page
below the visualisation itself.

## Running the visualisation locally

To run the visualization locally, run:
- `npm i` to install dependencies
- `npm run build` to compile the app and place it in the `dist/` directory
- `npm run serve` to serve from the `dist/` directory and open a page on your browser.

For a fast edit-refresh cycle when developing run `npm run serve-watch`.
This will start an http server and automatically re-compile the TypeScript,
HTML and CSS files whenever they change.
